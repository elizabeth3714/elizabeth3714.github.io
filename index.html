      Personal vision statement. <br />  
      <b>Innovation:</b> Innovation is not merely about creating something new, but about pushing envelopes, challenging conventions, and constantly evolving to find the best problem-driven solutions. By championing a growth mindset, I aim to make meaningful contributions that inspire progress, transform industries, and ultimately improve lives.<br />

Going beyond knowledge or academic achievements, showing intelligence means encompassing a deep curiosity, critical thinking skills, and adaptability. I endeavor to expand my intellectual horizons, seek out diverse perspectives, and embrace lifelong learning. <br />
