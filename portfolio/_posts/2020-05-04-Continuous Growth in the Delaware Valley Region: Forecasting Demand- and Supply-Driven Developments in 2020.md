**Re:** Continuous Growth in the Delaware Valley Region: Forecasting Demand- and Supply-Driven
Developments in 2020 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 1. Executive Summary <br>

Comprehensive regional development rooted in multi-nodal growth engines has been the new
norm in the context of American urban planning. Cross-boundary collaboration brings benefits towards
resource distribution, a balanced growth and overall sustainable development. Conjoining Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, and Delaware and in proximity to New York City and Washington D.C., the Delaware
Valley Region (DVR) serves as an example of regional collaboration in growth management. With the
forecasts of next ten-to-thirty years development, the region witnesses the potential of increased
population joining the workforce, along with the expansion and enhancement of regional infrastructure
networks. <br>

This report will summarize our recent study predicting future development demand based on
the demand-driven factor of population change and the supply-driven factor of infrastructure network
enhancement. It is predicted that development would intensify in Chester and Gloucester County as the
northern parts of Montgomery, Bucks and Burlington County. The development would be further
intensified along the proposed highway, concentrating in north Montgomery and Burlington County. The
findings provide insights for planners to formulate better policies to manage urban sprawl, leverage smart
growth and balance regional development. <br>

#### 2. Background <br>

The DVR as core urban clusters of the Greater Philadelphia Region connects five adjacent states.
While population grew from 5.1 million to 5.6 million, the developed area expanded by 1.5 times,
signaling significant urban sprawl. The DVR region is forecasted to receive over 658,000 residents and
more than 372,000 job opportunities from 2015 to 2045. (DVRPC, 2017) The region will face severe
environmental damage if urban clusters continue sprawling at the preceding speed. Therefore, a
projection study of future development demand will help observe development patterns and strategically
alleviate sprawl through formulation of policy instruments. <br>

#### 3. Data and Study Methods <br>

The study adopted a quantitative approach using spatial and demographic data, along with
regression analysis to predict future development demands. <br>

<ins>3.1 Data</ins> <br>

Data of land cover in 2000 to 2010 were obtained from USGS. 2010 and 2011 population census
and Esri Data and Maps have been referred to for demographic and transportation features. Population
and employment projections came from DVRPCâ€™s studies. <br>

<ins>3.1.1 Land Cover Change as Development Indicators</ins> <br>

The change of land cover from 2001 to 2011 indicates major developments in the decade.

<ins>3.1.2 Major Development Engines</ins> <br>

Population is the foremost driving factor in development since an increase in population will
bring about growth of density and employment. Intensive population growth has been observed in
Montgomery County and Bucks County in the north of Philadelphia, and northwest Gloucester County
and Burlington County. **(Figures 4 to 6)** <br>
