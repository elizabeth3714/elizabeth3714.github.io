### Overview <br>

This exercise applied geo-spatial machine learning to learn the inundation model in Calgary and predicted flooding hazard in another geography that is the city of Denvor. <br><!--more-->

### Motivation <br>
To adopt a scientific approach for studying and predicting natural disasters; to
assist policy makers in the environment and infrastructure section to formulate adaptive
strategies; and to protect assets and finance of local residents.

### Methodology & Algorithm <br>
Determining a city for comparison(Denver); Collecting
data; Feature engineering on selected features; Put the features into fishnet and then run first
Forward and Backward Selection for non-multicollinear criteria; Logistic regression for these
significant factors in R; apply model to Denver; Validate the model to determine accuracy and
generalizability of the model.
