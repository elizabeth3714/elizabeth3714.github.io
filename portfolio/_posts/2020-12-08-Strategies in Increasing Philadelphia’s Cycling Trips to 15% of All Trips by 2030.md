**Re:** Strategies in Increasing Philadelphia’s Cycling Trips to 15% of All Trips by 2030 <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Summary** <br>
Unlike many European countries where biking as a commuting mode comes from the
convention, the U.S. introduced biking as a mode for transportation and entertainments in the early
1990s (Lecture 12/3). Increase of biking as a commuting mode and a leisure activity would bring benefits
to people’s health and alleviate negative external effects to the environment. Philadelphia, as a city with
a level of complexity in transportation planning, targets to improve its biking trips to 15% of all trips by
2030. Strategies should be proposed to eradicate risk factors regarding cycling traffic, alleviate financial
burden, formulating regulations and emphasize the spillover effects from major educational institutes so
that the public would better accept and adapt to the lifestyle on bicycles. <br>
**Strategies** <br>
<ins>Setting an Overarching goal</ins> <br>
The goal of increasing biking trips to 15% is an ambitious one, as compared to the current level
of less than 5%<!--more--> (Lecture 12/3). However, setting a goal would have signaling effects. First, quantified
goals would always appear in a city’s policy documents such as a strategic plan. Such policy goes beyond
a guiding plan for the government. It could furtherreinforce the public’s awareness and acceptance of
the possibility that biking could become a daily commuting mode. Second, benching marking the level of
improvements helps formulate actionable strategies, which split up the increment objectives in several
aspects such as transportation urban design, finance and programs and education. <br>
<ins>Focusing on Details in Safe Street Design</ins> <br>
The road systems in the U.S. have been criticized as “unsafe” (Bicycle Coalition, 2020). Surveys
(Lecture 12/3) have revealed that over half of the population had different levels of concerns on safety
in biking. To improve road safety, a direct way is to focus on detailed road design. For example, biking
lanes are not a requirement in most roads in Philadelphia – the government should revise road design
guidelines and prescribe biking lanes with certain design standards alongside major roads for
automobile vehicles. Streets should be designed to strictly separate cycling flows from automobile flows
with proper physical barriers such as street curbs. <br>
Both existing and new biking lanes should be examined to ensure proper width. Street signs
should be provided in intersection and major roads to indicate cyclers going though so that automobiles
would pay attention and slow down. Street landscaping and green bufferwould help release drivers’
and riders’tension therefore it would lowerthe average traffic speed. <br>
<ins>Using the Opportunities of the Educational Hub</ins> <br>
Studies have shown that the rates of biking around universities are higher than other locations
(Pucher et al, 2011). This is because streets close to campuses tend to be more pedestrian-friendly
therefore a higher level of safety enhances people’s willingness to commute with bikes. The major
campuses in Philadelphia serve as hubs for bicycle related activities. The cycling network, therefore, has
the potential to be enhanced and connected, which would effectively leverage the city’s bicycle plan.
Furthermore, Philadelphia have advantages in universities that have advanced urban planning
training and research, which provides opportunities to experiment an ambitious progression to transit
the city into a bicycle-friendly era. Educators and students should encourage to participate in real-life
projectsto push forward creative biking programs in the city. <br>
<ins>Focused Areas</ins> <br>
While it might be unrealistic to build bike lanes all around the city, complete biking networks
should be developed in focus areas. Apart from university campuses, nearby open space demonstrates
potential to develop a holistic biking system. For example, streets connect nearby neighborhoods and
the Wissahickon Park have potential to build biking lanes and sidewalks. Biking lanes can be developed
along the Schuylkill trail which connect with nearby campuses and further expand into Center City
where historic landmarks attract visitors. A biking network with completeness would enable people to
commute from home to school, parks or places of interest. This further echoes with the concern of
safety, which is a direct drive for bike users. The Department of Transportation should make sure people
can bike along the biking network with no barriers and hassles.
<ins>Financing stipend and programs</ins> <br>
Financing incentives should be used as an instrument to attract bike use and bike service
provision. Currently, PennDOT and CFA provided funding and ensures 18% to 40% of the funds could be
injected to bicycle and pedestrian projects(Bicycle Coalition, 2020). This funding should be maintained
for years and the percentage can be further increased to guarantee continuous investments in bicycle
infrastructure. <br>
Similarly, the government should launch programs to encourage bicycle use and bicycle services
provided. Philadelphia witnessed a rapid popularization of bike sharing as exemplified with Indego in the
past three years. Companies promoting creative transportation should be supported by government
programs. Apart from bike sharing, companies should be able to hold events around bike sharing, such
as biking parties, group tourism and educational programs etc. Bike service providers can also provide
monthly pass and discounts for long-term service users which would help them lock customers who are
enthusiasts in cycling. <br>
<ins>Government Strategies, regulations, policies</ins> <br>
Policy makers should further formulate standards and benchmarks in major policy documents
such as a city’s comprehensive plan,strategic plan,zoning and design guidelines. For example, in
Philadelphia,the Complete Streets Design Handbook stipulate different types of bike lanes and its
design standards such as proper use, width, considerations and cautions etc. (Complete Streets Design
Handbook, 2020) Regulations and guidelines would legitimize the framework of the plan to increase
biking trips. <br>
Moreover, as one of the prevalentissuesin major American cities, specific design guidelinesfor
the road systemsregarding bike lanes still remains a blank page – no standards or regulations on
sidewalks or bike lanes have been presented in the subdivision and land development plan (DVRPC,
2011). Philadelphia, therefore, should review its subdivision and land development plan and make
amendments to incorporate design standards which will better accommodate biking traffic in the city.
Bike parking should also be incorporated in regulations with minimum bike parking spaces
requirements and parking lot design standards. Well-regulated parking services would improve people’s
user experience with biking and therefore it would further encourage people’s willingness to use bike. <br>

**Conclusion** <br>
Although it seems to be a big progress to increase biking trips to 15% of all trips by 2030,
Philadelphia should make use of its advanced transportation planning environment and provide best
practices in bicycle regulations. The completenessin bicycle network and design details are of critical
importance in boosting the bicycle network as a holistic system. Financial incentives would further
enhance people’s willingness to consume biking services while encourage companies to provide creative
biking services. Last but not least, regulations and policies would legitimize the framework of making
Philly a biking friendly city. <br>
