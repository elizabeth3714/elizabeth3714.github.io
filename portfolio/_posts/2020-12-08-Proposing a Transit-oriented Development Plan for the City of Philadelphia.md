**Re:** Proposing a Transit-oriented Development Plan for the City of Philadelphia <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>

**Summary** <br>
The city of Philadelphia, benefiting from its classic and contemporary cultural and historic
heritages, presents its potential as a destination for residents and visitors to gather, stay and celebrate.
To promote the city’s transits circulation and enhance urban functions with vibrancy and diversity, a
transit-oriented-development (TOD) plan should be adopted in the Philly 2050 plan. TOD mode would
alleviate congestion, decrease biofuel consumptions, provide clean environment, and further boost
economy. Your office should advocate major strategies include: 1) to enhance the inter-model
transportation network in the city and decrease people’s level of auto-dependency; 2) to achieve an
organic urban form through mixed uses, detailed design and compact development; 3) to leverage
community initiatives and public private participation using transit stations as catalysts. <br>

**Strategies** <br>
<ins>Decreasing Auto-dependency through a Multi-modal Transportation Network</ins> <br>
This twofold strategy, as pointed out by Vuchic (1999), should on the one hand compress the
volume of private cars, and on the other hand enhance the transit-oriented system in the inner core of a
city.<!--more--> The nitty-gritty should be examined regarding relation of private cars and public transit, and the
arterial streets versus the freeways (Vuchic, 1999, p. 264). To decrease the level of auto-dependency,
decrease inner city car use, and enhance the outer freeway system to undermine the disruption from
non-destination traffic. To enhance the multi-modal transportation network, the intermodal connection
and efficiency should be improved for better walking and user experience. <br>
a) Decreasing auto-dependency in inner city <br>
Philadelphia, like most American cities, demonstrate a centralized highway system with major
highwayssuch as I-95, I-76, and I-676 going through the downtown area. Traffic congestion in the peak
hours would impact negatively the road traffic in the inner city. An extended highway system would be
helpful to divert traffic during busy hours which would alleviate congestion by private cars in inner city
road network. Apart from infrastructure investment, “car-use-pricing” (Vuchic, 1999) would be applied
to disincentivize private car drivers from driving into inner city in peak hours. Strategies would be
charging for parking spaces, restrictions on on-street parking in major streets, and increasing toll fees at
certain hours, all of which would encourage people’s preference of using public transit to private
vehicles. <br>
While diverting outside freeway traffic, inner city should focus on a human-scaled
transportation and land use pattern. Philadelphia’s transit systems in city areas including subway, buses
and light rail fit in to right-of-way (ROW)1 Category C, meaning different transitmodes are not separated
– except forrailways which belong to Category A due to the complete separation (Vuchic, 1999, p. 42).
The predominantinterwoven transit and land use networks provide opportunities to enhance
intermodal integration, and better preserve the human-scaled city life, which would further facilitate
organic urban participation. <br>
b) Enhancing intermodal integration around transits <br>
Philadelphia should upgrade its existing multi-modal system to a seamlessly integrated transit
network (Vuchic, 1999, p.295). Specifically, subway and buses should serve as the dominant commuting
modes. In this way, punctuality and frequency in public transit would be crucial so passengers would
better reply on subway and buses for daily commute without worrying about long-time waiting or traffic
delay. Smart ticketing systemsshould be enhanced to betterintegrate multi-model transit. For example,
public transit usage would be much encouraged if passengers were able to use SEPTA card for subway,
buses, light rail, bike sharing, Uber/Lyft payment and even shopping at convenient stores around transit
stations. Ticketing discounts should also be provided for long-haul and intermodal transit ridership.
Physical integration (Vuchic, 1999, p.296) of the Multi-modal systemsshould also be addressed,
so passengers connectfrom subways, trains to buses and bicycle services in a fast and safe way. Detailed
design around transit locations would be crucial. For example, stations around City Hall should provide
weather-proof corridors with shelters and landscaping to improve walking experience. (Figure 1) <br>
<ins>Enhancing Commercial-oriented Mixed Uses and Compact City</ins> <br>
The physical integration of transit stations should be closely related to the functionality of an
urban core. A better walking experience around the transit center can be achieved by strategies to bring
in mixed land uses and growth with compact. Policy makers should release restrictions on development
and uses around transit stations. Such relaxation includes building height and density, building
alterations and use of the pedestrians and open space connected to major transit stations. As a result,
developers would be willing to enhance density around the transit stations and renew and redevelop
the building clusters. Various activities would be allowed include street vendor, performances,
gatherings and exhibitions etc. Detailed urban design should further encourage such activities to provide
locations for stay. Therefore, TOD mode should serve as a catalyst to interweave organic urban form
consisting of vibrant public-initiative activities. <br>
Meanwhile, major transit companies such as SEPTA should lead the “organizational integration”
(Vuchic, 1999, p.295) and expand its role beyond transitmanagementto involve property and events
management. Convenient stores and small retailers could be brought in around transit stations, where
as mentioned earlier, an integrated smart ticketing system could be involved. Such organizational
integration would benefit social activities, a better walkable streetscape, and in the end contributing to
a holistic urban and social organism. (Figures 2) <br>
<ins>Leveraging Social Initiated Events and Services</ins>
Last but not least, 2020 witnessed social, political and environmental catastrophes leading
towards structural changes in the U.S. and the world. Cities as engines for social movements should
continue serving as platformsfor civic participation and exhibition, in forms of art, creativity and opinion
expression. Philadelphia, therefore,should promote the TODmode as a catalyst to enhance the social
tie to the community. TOD mode would further catalyze possible public and private partnerships
between transit companies, developers and community initiated entrepreneurial services. This is
because “free-lancers and micro-entrepreneurs”would “diverse mass transit” (Cervero, 2001, p.17).
With proper regulations such as licencing, areas close to mass transit stations should allow small
vendors and performers to stay. Such “open, free-ranging transportation marketplace” conceives
“indigenous forms of entrepreneurial transit” (Cervero, 2001, p.17) which if successfully implemented,
would become new media for the public and artists to tell stories, create, and express opinions.(Figure
3) <br>
Despite the critique of TOD and commercial-oriented mixed uses that could accelerate
gentrification and replacement. In the post-pandemic era, Philadelphia should leverage economic
growth by enhancing the city’s circulation and vibrancy by attracting more population and have them
around the public domain. The emergence of community initiated entrepreneurial services would
further balance the negative impacts to disadvantaged groups in the city because of urban
gentrification. <br>

**Conclusion** <br>
In conclusion, to facilitate Philadelphia’s TOD plan, policy makers should regulate private cars in
city, balance traffic by alternative outside freeway networks, and build up organic urban clusters around
mass transit stations with mixed uses and community-initiated activities. This is crucial for the post-
pandemic revitalization since population and economy would be the critical enginesfor a city’s recovery
from disasters. <br>
